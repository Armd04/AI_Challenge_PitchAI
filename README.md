# UCI Spambase Classification Challenge

## Overview

Welcome to the Spambase Classification Challenge! This project is designed to evaluate your ability to work with real-world datasets, focusing on text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms.

The dataset you'll be working with is the UCI Spambase dataset, which is a labeled collection of email messages used to train algorithms to distinguish between legitimate messages and spam.

## Instructions

1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.
2. **Complete the missing parts of `main_code.py`** by implementing the functions for data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
3. **Ensure your code passes the tests** in `test_code.py` by running the test script.
4. **Create a pull request (PR)** back to this repository once you're done.

### Important Guidelines

- **Your GitHub email must match** the email you submitted your application with (if your GitHub email is different, we recommend creating a new GitHub profile with the email you used in your application, preferably your UWaterloo email).
- **Set your email to public** on your GitHub profile.
- **Do not apply any labels** on your PR. We will mark your PR as reviewed with a label when it has been reviewed. If you mark this yourself, your PR will be skipped.

## Task

You are provided with a partially implemented Python script `main_code.py`. Your task is to complete the functions that handle data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation. The goal is to develop a spam detection model using classification algorithms.

### Requirements

- Implement the missing functions in `main_code.py`.
- Use scikit-learn or similar libraries to build your models.
- Run `test_code.py` to ensure your code works as expected.

## Dataset

The dataset is provided in the `data/spambase.csv` file. It contains features extracted from email messages, labeled as spam (1) or not spam (0).

## Submission Process

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Complete the `main_code.py` with your implementation.
3. Run the `test_code.py` script to ensure that your implementation works correctly.
4. Push your changes to your forked repository.
5. Create a pull request back to this repository.

Make sure you follow the guidelines to avoid any issues with your submission. We look forward to reviewing your work!

Good luck!
